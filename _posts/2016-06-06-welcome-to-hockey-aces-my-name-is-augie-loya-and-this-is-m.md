Welcome to Hockey Aces! My name is Augie Loya, and this is my passion project.

This site is born out of a love for hockey, the desire to share my opinions, and images of my adventures in this great sport. 

As you explore this site, you will see that my favorite team in the National Hockey League is the Los Angeles Kings. With that said, my love of hockey transcends the Kings and the NHL. Hockey Aces will also feature some of the characters that I have met on the ice, the stands, and the faces in the crowd that make the hockey community so much fun!

Enjoy the site, and thank you for visiting!
